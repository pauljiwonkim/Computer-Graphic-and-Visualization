1. How do I approach designing software?
        What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
        What design process did you follow for your project work?
        How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

  In approaching the design and development of my 3D scene, I had a structured software design methodology, leveraging my understanding of trignometry, the tutorials I've learned through the modules, and plenty of research. This project has helped me hone my skills in conceptualizing software architecture by breaking down complex problems into manageable parts. The design process involved careful planning and testing to ensure functionality. These tactics in design can be implemented in subsequent projects by prioritizing transparent communication, modular design principles, and ongoing refinement informed by feedback.
  
   
3. How do I approach developing programs?
        What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
        How did iteration factor into your development?
        How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

  In terms of development, I adopted frequent and persistent iteration while learning and gaining further knowledge. Throughout the development process, whenever there was an obstacle in my way, I'd problem solve and find an approach to overcome it, sometimes needing to reassess and iterate until a viable solution is achieved. My approach to developing code evolved from initial experimentation to a more systematic and structured methodology, leading to the successful completion of the project.
   
5. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
        How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
        How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
  Computational graphics and visualizations played a huge role in developing my problem solving skills and iterative knowledge. I was able to visually see my modifications and iterations as I accumulated knowledge through research and overcame obstacles that appeared. These new knowledge and skills will further enhance my ability to tackle complex problems in the future and deepen my understanding of abstract concetps with greater efficiency in both my educational pathway as well as my professional pathway.
